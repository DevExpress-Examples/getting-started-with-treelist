# DevExtreme Angular TreeList - Getting Started 

This repository stores code examples of the Angular TreeList component for the [Getting Started with TreeList](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TreeList/Getting_Started_with_TreeList/) tutorial. The TreeList component uses a multi-column tree view to display data from a local or remote storage and allows users to sort, group, filter, and perform other data operations. This tutorial shows how to add the TreeList to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features.
